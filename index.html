            <p>She considered the birds to be her friends. She'd put out food for them each morning and then she'd watch
              as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day. She wondered what they would do if something
              ever happened to her. Would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one
              morning?

            <p>The bowl was filled with fruit. It seemed to be an overabundance of strawberries, but it also included
              blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and banana slices. This was the meal Sarah had every morning to start
              her day since she could remember. Why she decided to add chocolate as an option today was still a bit of a
              surprise, but she had been in the process of deciding she wanted to change her routine. This was a baby
              step to begin that start.

              <p>It was difficult for him to admit he was wrong. He had been so certain that he was correct and the
                deeply
                held belief could never be shaken.

              <p>He collected the plastic trash on a daily basis. It never seemed to end. Even if he cleaned the entire
                beach, more plastic would cover it the next day after the tide had come in.
